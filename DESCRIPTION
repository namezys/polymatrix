Package: polyMatrix
Version: 0.1.6
Title: Infrastructure for Manipulation Polynomial Matrices 
Description: 
  Implementation of class "polyMatrix" for storing a matrix of polynomials and implements 
  basic matrix operations; including a determinant and characteristic polynomial.
  It is based on the package 'polynom' and uses a lot of its methods to implement matrix operations.
  This package includes 3 methods of triangulazation of polynomial matrices:
  * Extended euclidean algorith (most classical but numeracal unstable)
  * Sylvester algorithm based on LQ decompostion
  * Inetrpolation
  Additionally, it includes basic methods for implementing
  Vector autoregressive Moving Average (VARMA) processes using a matrix of polynomials.
