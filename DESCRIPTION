Package: polyMatrix
Version: 0.1.4
Title: Infrastructure for Manipulation Polynomial Matrices 
Description: 
  The package "polyMatrix" introduces class "polyMatrix" 
  which stores a matrix of polynomials and implements 
  basic matrix operations includes a determinant and characteristic polynomial.
  It is based on package "polynom" and uses a lot of its methods to implement matrix operations.
  Additionally, it includes basic methods for implementing VARM processes using a matrix of polynomials.
