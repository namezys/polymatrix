Package: polyMatrix
Version: 0.9.11
Title: Infrastructure for Manipulation Polynomial Matrices 
Description: 
  Implementation of class "polyMatrix" for storing a matrix of polynomials and implements 
  basic matrix operations; including a determinant and characteristic polynomial.
  It is based on the package 'polynom' and uses a lot of its methods to implement matrix operations.
  This package includes 3 methods of triangularization of polynomial matrices:
  Extended Euclidean algorithm which is most classical but numerically unstable;
  Sylvester algorithm based on LQ decomposition;
  Interpolation algorithm is based on LQ decomposition and Newton interpolation.
  Both methods are described in
